## ðŸ”¬ For Academic Researchers

**CRITICAL**: This is an EXPLORATORY FRAMEWORK, not a proven system.

### Theoretical Foundation
- Based on David Marr's three levels of analysis
- Inspired by hexagonal patterns in nature (grid cells, molecular structures)
- Proposes hexagonal organization as a hypothesis for consciousness modeling

### What We Provide
- Framework for testing different architectural patterns
- Visualization tools for consciousness networks
- Benchmarking structure (with placeholder values)
- Modular system for experimentation

### What You Need to Add
- Actual consciousness measurements
- Real performance benchmarks
- Empirical validation
- Domain-specific implementations

### Known Limitations
- Some metrics show hexagonal architectures performing WORSE
- Memory usage may be higher due to increased connectivity
- Theoretical basis needs empirical validation

**This is a starting point for research, not an endpoint.**
